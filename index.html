          <p>Selma Ndi is the face and brain behind “GREEN” an IT start-up company, which builds computer software and also supplies medical and IT equipment to hospitals and companies in the North West and South West Regions of Cameroon. The answer to how she undertook a remarkable journey, evolving from a Supplies Accountant at CAMINEX SA, (an affiliate of the International Mining & Infrastructure Corporation (IMIC), to becoming an outstanding female entrepreneur in her mid-20s, lies in her passion to connect and inspire other young girls and women as well as her motivation to make a difference and work on her terms. She may be young, yes, but Selma is wise beyond her years, with a strong command of the English language and advanced intermediate skills in French. Her success so far lies in her key values of being enthusiastically attentive to detail, calm in the face of crisis, perseverant and courageous – attributes which have guaranteed client satisfaction. When it comes to education, she is well-grounded. Selma Ndi has an International MBA in Management and Sustainable Development from the ICT University, Yaoundé, Cameroon. A degree obtained, after graduating with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Accounting from the University of Buea. The smart, passionate, friendly and ambitious young woman is endowed with excellent abilities in marketing analysis, supply chain management, strategic and operations management, leadership and communication skills. Selma too, is proficient in Microsoft office applications, accounting software with web development skills required to enhance the online visibility goals of an organization</p>
          <p class="btmspace-30">Growing up in a family of 4 boys and 2 girls (and being the youngest of the girls), Selma developed the principle of responsibility and always with a smile to her face, seeks to create a world of love and compassion around her wherever she may be. That better explains her second world - that of volunteerism and humanitarian works. Coming from Sub Saharan Africa has given her first-hand experience to the problems young girls go through on a daily basis ranging from marginalization, abuse, neglect and lack of basic necessities like education. She co-founded "Wulwi Initiative" with her friends to empower the girlchild. That project, the "Wulwi Initiative" caught national attention and she was selected as the Youth of Excellence for Cameroon 2018, after winning the "les Nanas Awards". Selma has fully devoted herself to empowering girls mentally and physically to be able to break the glass ceiling and flourish in their personal and professional ambitions through Wulwi Initiative. She is the Finance and Administative Director of Wulwi Initiative. [&hellip;]</p>
